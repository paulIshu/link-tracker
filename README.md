## Introduction

MyLeads is designed to help users maintain a list of website links that are important or interesting to them. It provides a simple interface to add new links, view the existing list, and delete all saved links. This project serves as a practical example of how to work with local storage in a web application.

## Features

- **Add Links:** Users can add new website links to their list by entering the URL and clicking the "Add" button.

- **View Links:** The application displays the list of saved website links in an organized format with clickable links that open in a new tab.
